1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is the first and most crucial step in any data pipeline. Raw data often contains noise, missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies, which need to be addressed before performing any analysis or model training. Here’s how we preprocess the data:
Loading the Data: Typically, data is loaded from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs. With Pandas, the pd.read_csv() function can be used to load data from CSV files.
Handling Missing Values: Missing data can be handled in several ways. One common approach is to fill missing values with the mean, median, or mode. Pandas provides the fillna() function for this
Removing Duplicates: Duplicate data points can skew the results. The drop_duplicates() method is used to remove duplicate rows.
Encoding Categorical Data: Many machine learning algorithms require data to be in numeric form. Categorical variables can be encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding
Feature Scaling: Sometimes, different features in the data have different scales, which can affect machine learning models. To standardize the features, we can use Scikit-learn’s StandardScaler.

2. Data Transformation
Once the data is cleaned, the next step is data transformation, which involves preparing the data for analysis or machine learning model training. Data transformation includes feature engineering, splitting data, and applying transformations to improve the quality of the features
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features that might improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. For example, creating a new feature like the "age group" from the "age" column
Splitting Data: Before building any models, we split the data into training and testing sets. This is important for evaluating model performance. Scikit-learn’s train_test_split() function can be used for this.
Feature Selection: Sometimes, not all features are relevant for the model. Feature selection helps in reducing overfitting and improving model performance. Scikit-learn offers techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for this

3. Data Loading
The final step in the pipeline is loading the transformed data into a desired format or storage. After preprocessing and transforming the data, it’s ready to be used in machine learning models or saved for future use.

Loading into Machine Learning Models: After preprocessing, the transformed data is fed into machine learning models. For example, using Scikit-learn’s LogisticRegression model:
Saving the Transformed Data: If the preprocessed data needs to be saved for future use or further analysis, we can save it in formats such as CSV, Excel, or SQL databases using Pandas
